# Tictactoe Game Project ðŸŽ®

Welcome to the **Tic Tac Toe Game Play Web Application**! ðŸš€ In this project, our goal is to create a classic tic-tac-toe game using Python. But wait, there's a twistâ€”we're building a web-based version using the powerful Django framework.

## Game Rules:

- **Players:** Two players participateâ€”one plays as X, and the other as O.
- **Game Board:** We have a 3x3 grid of cells where players place their marks.
- **Objective:** The goal is simpleâ€”get three of your marks (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **Winning Condition:** If a player achieves this, they win the game!
- **Tie Game:** If all cells are marked and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Features:

1. **Django Web Interface:**
   - We've leveraged Django to create an interactive web interface for our tic-tac-toe game.
   - Players can access the game through their browsers and enjoy a seamless experience.

2. **Player Turns:**
   - The game alternates between X and O turns.
   - Players click on an empty cell to place their mark.

3. **Win Detection:**
   - After each move, we check if any player has won.
   - If so, we declare the winner and end the game.

4. **Tie Game Handling:**
   - If all cells are filled and no winner is declared, we announce a tie.

## How to Play:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up your Django environment.
3. Run the application.
4. Invite a friend to playâ€”you can even challenge yourself!

## Future Enhancements:

- **AI Opponent:** Imagine playing against a computer-controlled opponent. We could implement an AI player using algorithms like Minimax.
- **Customizable Grid Size:** Why limit ourselves to 3x3? Let's allow users to choose different grid sizes.
- **Leaderboard:** Keep track of wins and losses. Who's the ultimate tic-tac-toe champion?

Feel free to contribute, improve, and make this game even more exciting! Happy tic-tac-toe-ing! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ”´â­•
